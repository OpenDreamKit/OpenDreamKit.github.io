We have set various objectives and tasks. The nine objectives must be
reached thanks to tasks,
which are divided into seven workpackages. The various tasks are
considered accomplished after the deliverables
related to them are implemented and/or published.

We use github as a task management tool: each task and each deliverable is made
into a *github issue* where discussions are carried out. All our discussion and development
process is public.
