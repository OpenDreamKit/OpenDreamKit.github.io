## About this blog post

For a number of years, I have been following the announcements of the
[CICM (Conference in Intelligent Compupter
Mathematics)](http://www.cicm-conference.org/), not quite daring to
hop in given that this is on the far fringe of my usual research topic
(Computational Algebraic Combinatorics).  This year gave me the
occasion to attend for the first time, being honoured to deliver [an
invited talk](/2016/07/28/CICM-invited-talk/) there about the
category infrastructure in Sage.

After the conference, I enjoyed two days of hiking and biking in the
nearby Bielowiesa national park which gave me plenty of time for
afterthoughts (well, when not busy dodging mosquitoes), hence this
blog post.

## About CICM

Since a decade, CICM collocates several workshops: Calculemus
(automated reasoning systems and Computer algebra), DML (Digital Math
Library), MKM (Mathematical Knowledge Management), AISC (Artificial
Intelligence and Symbolic Computation) with the deliberate strategy to
bring together a diverse crowd of people. In particular, the Tetrapod
workshop is meant to exchange ideas between people involved in the
four main areas of *mechanized mathematics*: computation, data,
knowledge management, and deduction (proof systems).

I very much enjoyed the experience, discovering a nice and welcoming
community, and participating to many enlightening discussions. It was
a good opportunity to step back and enlarge my views.

## Some talks I particularly enjoyed

### Invited talk of John Harrison on HOL Light: Algebraic Combinatorics at CICM!

[John Harrison](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/) is the lead
developer of [HOL Light](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/),
a proof system based on higher order logic. I did not quite expect to
hear about algebraic combinatorics in this conference! So I much
enjoyed the part about the formalization of the Wilf-Zeilberger
algorithm for proving identities.

John's reflections reminded me of Florent's on his work on the
formalization of the Littlewood-Richardon's rule: in algebraic
combinatorics, the nitty-gritty details can become very cumbersome
(lengthy case studies) to write down while being, most of the time,
irrelevant. Hence the natural -- and actually vital -- tendency in
this field to skip them in proofs. Here proof systems could contribute
added value, by mechanizing at least the proof verification, if not
parts of the proof of the nitty-gritty details.

In the case of WZ, the nitty gritty details all come from the behavior
differences between rational functions as algebraic versus analytic
functions (simplification, convergence).

### Michael Kohlhase's talk on OpenDreamKit and Math-in-the-Middle

Energetic as usual! The goal was to expose our ongoing work to the
audience, and this triggered quite some interesting exchanges.

### Dennis Müller's talk on alignments (Rosetta Stone's on steroids)

Dennis presented his ideas about a database of *alignments* between
systems, in MMT. Think the [Rosetta
stone](http://www.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/rosetta.html) dear
to Tim Daly's heart, crowd-sourced and mechanized.

An alignment is a matching between two names for the same concept,
typically in two different systems, like:

1. "cardinality" in Sage vs "Size" in GAP
2. "Groups" in GAP vs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groups
3. "Parent" in Sage vs "carrier" in formal logic systems
4. "Groups" vs "AdditiveGroups" in Sage

An alignment can be formal as in 1 (exactly the same concept). Even
more formal would be a proven alignment between e.g. two proof
systems. On the other hand, 3 is informal (the alignment only occurs
when speaking about the elements of an algebraic structure; also the
carrier is the underlying set while the parent is the set endowed with
its structure), and 2 as well since the page content on wikipedia' is.
The alignment can also be up to a "functor", as in 3 where
multiplication is mapped to addition.

Alignments are at the core of our so-called Math-in-the-Middle
approach.

Dennis's thesis:

- We should care both about formal and informal alignments, i.e. about
  *flexiformality* as the [KWARC group](http://kwarc.info/) would put
  it.

- The Rosetta stone should extend to proof systems, knowledge
  management systems, ...

- We can achieve this by crowd sourcing & mechanizing: in short, have
  system authors and users progressively contribute the alignments
  they know of (manually or systematically), and compute adequate
  transitive closures.

  To bootstrap the social process, it's important that each
  contribution gives immediate added value for the contributor.

### Florian Rabe's MMT tutorial

[Florian](https://kwarc.info/people/frabe/) led, with the help of the
other KWARC members, the first official introductory tutorial to
[MMT](https://svn.kwarc.info/repos/MMT/doc/html/index.html)
(Meta-Meta-Theory). This was a good occasion for me to learn more
about this system for representation of mathematical knowledge, with a
strong emphasis on genericity (the meta-meta keyword): bring your own
logic, your own syntax, ...

### Jacques Carette's talk on MathScheme and code generation

After years as core developer in the very informal world of Maple,
[Jacques Carette](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~carette/) is now
exploring the other extreme, and in particular how to best exploit the
mathematical knowledge in the design of mathematical systems (rings a
bell?).

Together with William Farmer, he has been developing
[MathScheme](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/research/mathscheme/) "An
Integrated Framework For Computer Algebra And Computer Theorem
Proving". A particular focus of his talk (or of my attention?) was on
automatic "code" generation, in particular using views (I'll be using
"code", but this includes as well proofs, ...). For example, he
manages to avoid all the code duplication that we have in Sage / GAP
between the hierarchies for additive structures and multiplicative
structures by generating automatically one for the other (or maybe
both from yet another?); in practice he uses Haskell's substitution
feature to transliterate statically all the operations appearing in
the code: 1->0, *->+, ...

### My invited talk on Sage category infrastructure :-)

I enjoyed delivering it! And there were quite some discussion during
and after the talk. Here are my [slides](http://www.cicm-conference.org/2016/slides/I3.pdf).

I first introduced my pet analogy that Sage categories are the
bookshelves of the Sage library: as mathematicians, to lookup features
of groups (e.g. definitions, theorems, proofs, algorithms, data), we
go to the library, and search through the bookshelf about group
theory. Similarly, when computing with groups, Sage searches through
the Sage category of groups to find code (and doc, and tests).

The bookshelves are organized hierarchically: sometimes the feature we
need is more specific, and we lookup the sub bookshelf about e.g. the
theory of finite groups. Sometimes it will be more general, and we
lookup the larger bookshelf about semigroup theory.

I then put some focus on code bloat taming by:

- Generating automatically the inheritance

- Using the lattice structure of categories/theories to only implement
  the non trivial categories (e.g. those containing code)

## Knowledge use in systems: stuff I learned or rethought about

From the discussions at CICM, there is a consensus that, with the
growth of proof/computation/... mathematical systems, explicitly using
the mathematical knowledge is central in the design and implementation
of the former.  Of course, given the themes of the conference, there
is a strong bias. Still I was glad to hear it was not just a fancy of
mine :-)

In practice, many systems have developed infrastructure to use such
knowledge:

- Computer algebra systems: categories in Axiom/Aldor/MuPAD/Sage
- Proof systems: Gonthier's team MathComp library for Coq
- Knowledge management system: MMT

In particular, the development of such infrastructure has always been
prompted by concrete scaling needs, and in particular code bloat
taming. The key ideas are of the same nature, but different systems
have different implementations and are more advanced in different
directions due to the variety of constraints:

- using an existing language or not
- static vs dynamic
- formal vs informal
- current breath and depth of the system. E.g. mathcomp was originally
  designed for the proof of a specific theorem which made it
  relatively deep but narrow.

So it's good to be discussing across systems to learn from each other
what kind of issues our own systems may be facing next, and how such
issues have possibly been tamed elsewhere.

Below are notes about various things that were discussed and matured,
or that I learned at the occasion of the workshop.

### Terminology

Of course, coming from different communities, we use different
terminologies. In fact terminology was the main problem I have had
when typing those notes. So one thing to discuss further would be the
standardization of terminology for all the concepts involved.

In the mean time, here are some more or less informal alignments:

| Sage                               | logic world (e.g. MMT) |
|------------------------------------+------------------------|
| Sage category                      | theory                 |
| subcategory                        | category extension     |
| join or intersection of categories | push out of theories   |
| meet of categories                 | pull back?             |
| parent                             | carrier                |
| functor                            | view                   |

Here are some other concepts for which we need to decide on common
terminology:

- realms, bookshelves, ...
- Mixins
- functorial construction
- category with axiom, category defining/implementing an axiom
- stating that the implementation of a feature (e.g. a view, an axiom,
  a construction) should be split into little chunks, one for each
  category it is relevant for. By lack of something better, I'll speak
  for now of *split implementation* of a feature (better suggestions
  welcome!). Paul suggests this has been called "small theory approach"
  in the logic world.

### "Mixins"

Compared to other areas, in mathematics there tends to be relatively
few fundamental concepts (e.g. magmas, associativity, ...); all the
richness comes from the many ways those concepts can be combined to
obtain, e.g.  fields. More so, new concepts tend to appear very low in
the concept hierarchy (with exceptions; e.g. "connected" which appears
at the level of graded modules); there may be a bias in algebra
w.r.t. other areas (analysis?).

A key point is that knowledge enables splitting the features into
small feature sets (e.g. features of commutative groups that are not
necessarily valid for all groups) that are manageable, reusable, and
composable according to the hierarchy of realms, to cater for the
variety of combinations of the basic concepts.

In Sage, each such chunk is essentially a collection of "Mixin
classes", together with some metadata.

Terminology: do we want to use the word "Mixin" to speak about those
feature sets?

### Formally defining versus implementing a realm

Implementing "Groups" can have two rather distinct means:

- formally defining what groups are (operations / axioms)
- providing the features that holds for groups

Typically, in a book about group theory, the first pages will be about
the definition (and recap about semigroups), and all the rest about
the features of groups. In Sage, we focus mainly on the later. Jacques
liked the bookshelf analogy to express that.

Those two goals may be better achieved in two steps. Indeed, the
formal definitions tend to be tricky, in particular to avoid
definition loops: for example, to state that additive groups are
modules over the integer ring, one first need to define this ring
which is ... an additive group itself. On the other hand, the amount
of material is much smaller, since one really only need to define the
basic concepts (magmas, associativity, ...) and combine them by
trivial push outs.

Providing the features can then be done in a later step. So we would
have:

- a hierarchy of *defining theories*, with just the theories needed to
  define new concepts, and possibly some trivial push outs for naming
  purposes; e.g. we would have trivial push out theory that just
  states that a "monoid" is a "magma" that is both "associative" and
  "unital".
- a hierarchy of *feature theories*

the latter being typically ``conservative theory extensions'' of the
former.

Somehow this is exactly what we are doing for Sage in the
Math-in-the-Middle approach: we use MMT's latin1 as defining theories,
Sage categories as feature theories, and the semantic annotations of
Sage categories (aka Sage <-> MMT alignments) to produce the interface
theories aligning the two.

### Inheritance versus composition and views

There are several ways to express that a ring is a set endowed with
both a multiplicative monoid and an additive monoid structure. In
Sage, we use plain inheritance, having Ring inherit from
AdditiveMonoid and MultiplicativeMonoid. These two are implemented
independently (duplication!!!). If both define a function
"cayley_graph", there is an ambiguity for rings: is the "cayley graph"
about the additive or multiplicative structure.

An alternative -- used in MMT, MathComp, and ... -- is to use
composition and views, saying that Ring is the composition of
MultiplicativeMonoid and AdditiveMonoid, both being views on
Monoid. Then, the operation cayley_graph can be disambiguated by
accessing it through MultiplicativeMonoid.cayley_graph or
AdditiveMonoid.cayley_graph.

Using composition only would be very cumbersome: to access the zero of
the ring we would need to do use something like
`AdditiveCommutativeMonoid.AdditiveMonoid.UnitalMagma.unit`. This is
resolved in MMT by doing explicit imports/aliases: "Ring.zero" is an
alias for "AdditiveMonoid.zero" which itself is a view on
"Monoid.unit" which itself is a view on "UnitalMagma.unit". That's all
fine because this is all resolved statically, with no runtime overhead
(when it's about computation).

Claudio mentioned that one particular reason for using composition in
MathComp is that Coq does not support multiple inheritance.

### Referencing subcategories from super categories

In Sage, one can create the subcategory of a category (say Groups) by
applying axioms or constructions (say Finite) with the syntax:

    Groups().Finite()

This is reflected in the code by having the class Groups holding an
attribute Finite that references the class FiniteGroups.

Jacques rightfully pointed out that this is an anti-pattern: a class
(in a rather large sense) should not need to be aware of its
subclasses, in particular so that adding new subclasses does not
require changing the code of preexisting classes.

That's a valid concern which is mitigated by concrete added value:

- From a user interface point of view, it's very handy to be able to
  create new categories from basic ones: this enables having a single
  entry points for groups, from which one can create all variants
  (finite, finitely generated, compact, quotient, ...).

  An alternative syntax would be to use push outs only: Groups() &
  FiniteSets(). This would not require a priori references to
  subcategories. But from a Pythonic perspective, the former syntax
  further enables the discovery by introspection of which
  axioms/constructions can be applied.

- This enables a fast algorithm for computing joins (roughly linear in
  the size of the created hierarchy)

- The reference Groups -> FiniteGroups could be set a posteriori by
  the FiniteGroups source code, rather than the Groups source
  code. This is not done so just to support lazy loading of the library.

## Using views + MMT + alignments for Sage profit?

Jacques's talk was thought provoking, as not only he could use views
to reduce duplication in knowledge representation, but also in code,
thanks to Haskel's code transliteration features.

Combined with the various other discussion points, I am now wondering
whether we could use *dynamic views* for producing uniformly, from
views and alignments represented in MMT, automatically generated split
implementations of

- the exp / log constructions between additive structures and multiplicative structures

- the subquotient, quotient, subobjects and isomorphic objects constructions

- a proper forgetful functor

- the semantic handle Sage-XXX interface

- the additive structures hierarchy from its multiplicative counterpart

- facade from non facade parents (aka the OO vs modular programming disease)

- ...

### Context: code duplication in Sage

It's been a while that the code duplication between additive and
multiplicative structures in Sage (and most if not all other
computational systems I know of) has been itching.

I should say that it's not yet critical though: we currently live with
only a small subset of features for additive structures (basically
those really needed for rings) and having those being duplicates of
the equivalent features of multiplicative structures. That's
manageable and a plausible trade-off for some simplicity (using plain
OO).

Still interesting to scratch further, if not just out of curiosity.

### No static transliteration in Python

The first thing that had stopped me from scratching this issue so far
is that, unlike Haskel, Python has no transliteration feature. At
least not that I know of. Is this intrinsic? After all Python allows
for full read-write reflection on the code AST, so nothing prevents
code rewriting (what about Cython?).

The main difficulty however is that there is little type information
to determine, in a piece of code, when a method call should be
transliterated or not. Let's take the following method:

    def f(self, i):
        return self+self, i+i

If we want to transliterate from additive to multiplicative, it's
clear that we want to replace `self+self` by `self*self`. However
should `i+i` be replaced by `i*i`? Maybe this can be derived by type
inference from the context, but this is a non trivial endeavour.

### But we have *adapters* for dynamic transliteration

Let's take the Sage-GAP interface. For the longer while we have had a
*semantic handle interface* which allows for manipulating a handle `h`
to a GAP group `G` as if it was a native Sage group. It works using
the classical [adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern)
design pattern: the handle `h` is wrapped in an *adapter object* `Gh`
with adapter methods like `cardinality` that delegates calls of the
form `Gh.cardinality()` to the equivalent GAP call `Size(G)` thanks to
an

It had been itching me for a long time that this was available only
for groups. Last january in Saint Andrews I started making a split
implementation of this. So now we had semantic handle interfaces for
semigroups, magmas, etc for free, and for rings and such for the price
of implementing just the additional adapter methods.

The next step I initiated in Saint Andrews was to generate
automatically this split implementation from alignements. Indeed, most
of the time all we need to know to generate an adapter method is the
name alignment and some basic signature information.

This is still work in progress with Samuel Lelièvre:

     https://github.com/nthiery/sage-gap-semantic-interface

### Putting things together: the Exp/Log functors for free

What I realized over last week-end is that putting together

- The interface theory for additive structures in Sage
- The additive -> multiplicative view in MMT
- The interface theory for multiplicative structures in Sage
- Dennis' service for doing the transitive closure of the above
  alignments
- An automatic generation of adapters as above

we could generate automatically, in Sage, the Exp construction that
takes an additive monoid and adapts it into a multiplicative monoid.

We already have a crude implementation of the Exp construction in
Sage. We use it when we have an additive monoid and get frustrated by
the lack of features available. However this construction is manually
generated and thus very far from complete. The automatic generation
would also make for a much smaller code base which is thus easier to
optimize (e.g. compile with Cython).

Of course the same could be done for the Log functor.

### The additive structures hierarchy from its multiplicative counterpart

The hierarchy of categories for additive structures could be generated
from the multiplicative one. To compute an operation x on an additive
monoid M, one would apply the equivalent operation on the
corresponding multiplicative monoid.

When no alignment exist for an operation, one could provide one
automatically by adding an additive_ prefix to the operation
name. This trick could be used as well for disambiguation, so that a
ring would have two operations additive_cayley_graph and cayley_graph,
mimicking composition.

### Further applications

An adapter method for an alignment between f and g typically looks like:

    def f(x, y):
        wrap( g( unwrap(x), unwrap(y) ) )

An other location in Sage where we use very similar methods are
quotients. Typically the product in a quotient A of an ambient space B
is computed using:

    def mul(x,y):
        retract( g(lift(x), lift(y)) )

where retract is the quotient map from B to A, and lift a
section. More generally the same adapter can work for subquotients,
assuming proper lift and retract maps.

Based on this principle, we currently have in Sage a manually written
split implementation of a hierarchy of categories for computing the
basic operations on A just from the lift and retract map to B. The
number of features available depend on whether A is a subquotient, a
subobject, a quotient of or is isomorphic to B.

Using the trivial alignment, this hierarchy of categories could be
automatically generated. This would require some additional semantic
information, to specify which operation actually pass down to
quotients, subquotients, or subobjects, and not just isomorphic
objects.

### About the dynamic vs static overhead

Using dynamic adapter classes and methods rather than static code
transliteration has a cost. Let's consider for example the `Log`
functor, and analyse the overhead of calling a method `g` through an
adapter method `f` on adapter objects `x` and `y`, e.g. as in
`x.f(y)`:

    def f(x, y):
        wrap( g( unwrap(x), unwrap(y) ) )

We further assume that the adapter class and methods are written in
Cython. The adapter method will typically be a generic Cython
implementation shared between all adapter methods with a given
signature, and specialized through a closure.

Costs:

- `unwrap` calls: each call to unwrap above costs a Cython method
  calls and a C pointer dereferencing. In a static world both could be
  done at compile time, in particular through inlining.

- `wrap` call: one Cython function call and the creation of a Cython
  object. In a static world, whenever the wrapped object is a
  temporary value, there are chances that the compiler could avoid
  it's creation.

- `g` call: usual cost of calling `g`, potentially saving the virtual
  resolution if the adapter is specialized on a specific monoid.

- `f` call: a Cython method call; potentially saving the virtual
  resolution?

Altogether, one could tentatively hope that the overall cost would be
of the order of magniture of a Cython method call (with virtual
resolution).  For very low granularity Cython methods like arithmetic
on small fields, there still will be a high overhead compared to what
could achieve with static code transliteration. On the other hand, the
overhead would be tentatively negligible at higher granularity and for
plain Python code. This remains of course to be confirmed by
benchmarks.
