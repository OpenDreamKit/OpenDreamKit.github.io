OpenDreamkit is highly involved in dissemination activities and the introduction
of researchers and educators to the Jupyter ecosystem. This is not only limited
to researchers within the physical sciences and mathematics. Over the last couple
of months at Sheffield and now at Leeds, we have been working with some
digital scientists from the [Research Methods Institute](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/smi)
to develop some teaching materials around the collection and use of Web Data.

Both, Binder and the Jupyter notebook have played an integral part in the development
and delivery of this series of workshops. The use of these technologies not only
makes it easier to share research and educational materials but, if used appropriately,
they can serve as valuable pedagogical tools.

At the moment all of the materials are focused on Python as the programming language
for the acquisition, processing and visualisation of the data. The developed materials cover an introduction to regular expressions, dictionaries, json and XML data, web scraping and HTTP requests and APIs. In the upcoming months, we plan to add more content on streams and programmatic web scraping. Also, we have plans
to produce an R version of the materials using again, Jupyter notebooks and
Binder's improved support for the R language.

The current version of the materials was developed as part of a series of workshops
for digitial scientists over the last two weeks of May 2018.

If you want to have a look at the materials or wish to suggest additional content
