## OpenDreamKit at Groups St Andrews in Birmingham ##

[Groups St Andrews](http://www.groupsstandrews.org/) is a conference series with
a conference every four years. This year's Groups St Andrews will be in
Birmingham, and I will attend, bring
a [poster](/public/groups-st-andrews-2017.pdf), give a contributed talk
about computing in permutation groups, and teach a course on GAP.

This post serves the main purpose of providing a page on the OpenDreamKit website
that can hold all the links that will appear on the poster, and possible further
information.
