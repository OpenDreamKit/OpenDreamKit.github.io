On October 30th of 2019, OpenDreamKit underwent its final formal
review by the European Commission, represented by three reviewers and
our finance and project officers. About twenty of us went to
Luxembourg for
[two days of rehearsals](/meetings/2019-10-30-Luxembourg/)
before an
[intense day of presentation](/meetings/2019-10-30-Luxembourg/ProjectReview/)
of our achievements [in the last reporting period](/project/reports/#reporting-period-3),
and in the project as a whole.

After the presentations and in-depth discussions, the feedback from
the reviewers was enthusiastic, with comments such as “[you have] done extremely
good job” or “heroic management” and strong encouragements to keep
applying and shooting for the moon. As in previous reviews, we
highlighted that OpenDreamKit's work was but the tip of the iceberg;
all we did was to exploit the special resources the EU entrusted us to
knock down some tough hurdles that were preventing the ball to roll.

**The pride shall go to our communities!**

## Content

Nicolas launched the day by showcasing some of our 
[use cases](/tag/use-case), before
[telling a story](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OpenDreamKit/demo-semigroup-representation-theory/blob/master/demo.ipynb)
of his successive PhD students, to illustrate how the very diverse
achievements of OpenDreamKit and our communities were coming together
to enable novel experimental research.

Min [presented](/meetings/2019-10-30-Luxembourg/ProjectReview/WP4.pdf)
our contributions to Jupyter-based user interfaces and
virtual environments, reflecting along the way on the future of the
Jupyter community. The impact was illustrated by software
demonstrations by Marijan (micromagnetism), Olexandr ([GAP](/meetings/2019-10-30-Luxembourg/ProjectReview/WP4_lightning_talk-Jupyter_and_GAP.pdf)), Olivier
(training), and Marcin (3D).

(Pari), Daniel (Singular) --

the achievements toward higher
performance on modern architectures, both within computational
components and when combining them. He highlighted algorithmic
advances, common trends, lessons learned and perspectives.

Izabela and Nicolas [detailed](/meetings/2019-10-30-Luxembourg/ProjectReview/WP1.pdf) the project management: use of
resources, explanations of deviations, risks management, follow up to
recommendations, etc; then we received feedback from our financial
officer on how to polish our financial and technical reports.

Luca [showcased](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit.github.io/blob/master/meetings/2019-10-30-Luxembourg/ProjectReview/WP3.ipynb)
the variety of Virtual Research Environments that can
be constructed from our toolkit. He revealed the massive plumbing
efforts (modularity, packaging, ...) that underlined it, and their
impact on usability and sustainability.

Michael [explained](/meetings/2019-10-30-Luxembourg/ProjectReview/WP6.pdf) the research that was conducted on exploiting
mathematical knowledge for interoperability between mathematical
computational systems, databases, and even proof systems; concrete
outcomes range from proof of concepts to production grade tools, notably
to support FAIR mathematical data.

Viviane, with the help of Erik, [outlined](/meetings/2019-10-30-Luxembourg/ProjectReview/WP2) our massive community
building, training, and dissemination activities. 110 events touching
1800 trainees and 5000 students, and involving a majority of the
consortium. The reviewers were amazed and said so, adding that the
level of outreach went far beyond anything they imagined for this
project; they specifically congratulated Viviane for the strong
diversity actions.

Nicolas was left with the tough task of [wrapping up](/meetings/2019-10-30-Luxembourg/ProjectReview/wrapup-final.pdf)
four years of hard work by 50+ participants. He highlighted the keys
to success, notably the open management and bottom-up approach, the
impact of Research Software Engineers, the needs of the involved
communities, and the ongoing efforts toward future funding. He
concluded with his deep gratitude to the consortium for this amazing
human endeavor, **with a special thought to all those that entrusted
years of their career to temporary positions in this project**.

## Aftermath

After the reviewers comments and departure, we all were left with an
intense feeling of having built together a community. Hence, before we
all went for a well deserved celebration dinner, we spontaneously
started to brainstorm about the future of that community, beyond
ephemera and geographic artifacts such as EU projects.

Stay tuned :-)
