Last January, Viviane Pons, Jessica Striker and Jennifer Balakrishnan organized 
 the first [WomenInSage](https://wiki.sagemath.org/days82)
 event in Europe with OpenDreamKit. 20 women spent a week together coding and learning in a rented
house in the Paris area.

# The Workshop

## Opening event

To open the workshop, Viviane, Jessica, and Jennifer gave a series of [introduction 
to Sage](https://wiki.sagemath.org/days82_sageintro) lectures at the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris,
covering combinatorics and number theory.

## The Week

The workshop then moved to the rented house. There, we organized
*short talk sessions* to get to know our respective research fields and expectations
for the week. After that, we were able to split into small groups to work on many different
projects: STL export, Krummer surfaces, Kuznyechik cipher, Motzkin words, Shioda invariants,
and more. We also had presentations on *How to contribute to Sage* (with a crash course 
on git) and *How to write a Sage package*. Every evening, we had a *Status report*
session to share our progress with the group. You can read our program and final status
reports on [the event wikipage](https://wiki.sagemath.org/days82). 

## Special PyLadies coding cafe

Viviane Pons is one of the organizer of the local Paris chapter for [PyLadies](http://www.pyladies.com/).
She organized a meeting between the WomenInSage mathematician and the PyLadies developers.
We were welcomed by Algolia for an afternoon of coding-and-chatting with the PyLadies.

# Impact

*The data presented here come from a post-event questionnaire sent to the participants.*

The gender gap is very important in the mathematic development community. In the 
OpenDreamKit project, among the 54 participants we are only 3 women. This reflects
the global situation in the field. Many mathematician women are still hesitant to join
our community and lack confidence in their abilities as developers. Organizing a
women targeted event is a way to motivate them and building up self-confidence in a safe
and casual atmosphere.

The women who attended the conference had various level of programming experience
ranging from 1 (no experience) to 5 (a lot of experience).

![1: 1 people, 2: 7 people, 3: 3 people , 4: 5 people, 5: 1 people](/public/images/womenInSage/programming-knowledge.png){:class="img-responsive"}

This disparity also reflected in their knowledge of Sage. 

![1: 1 people, 2: 8 people, 3: 3 people , 4: 3 people, 5: 2 people](/public/images/womenInSage/sage-knowledge.png){:class="img-responsive"}

As for contributions, only 4 participants had contributed to Sage in the past 
which included the 3 organizers. Also, a majority of participants had never attended
a Sage Days before. Actually, 6 of them had never even heard of Sage Days and 2 
of them said they did not think it was "for them".

!["I had never heard of Sage Days": 35.3%, "I thought Sage Days were not for me": 11.8%, "I wanted to but never had the time nor the occasion": 17.6% , 
"I attended once": 17.6%, "I attended many times": 17.6%](/public/images/womenInSage/sage-days-attendance.png){:class="img-responsive"}

To the question "How did the fact that the event was targeted to women impact your decision to come?  (Would you have participated in a classical SageDays)",
Many participants answered that it was indeed a factor a their decision.

<cite>Yes, but it helped. I didn´t feel so sure about my skills and being surrounded by women made things easier.</cite>

<cite>It was a new experience that I don't regret at all.</cite>

<cite>I might have participated, but would have been less confident.</cite>

<cite>I have participated in and benefited from classical SageDays, but found this event to be even better at creating an atmosphere where everyone felt empowered to learn and contribute.</cite>

<cite>I made a special effort I would not have done for regular sage days.</cite>

One of the participant said she would not have felt comfortable sharing a house
with men but that this event was such positive experience that she would now consider
it for other Sage days. The event helped building up the confidence of the participants, 9 of them said 
they felt more confident to attend classical Sage Days after the event.

![What are the chances you attend a "normal" sage days in the future? 1:0 people, 2: 0 people, 3: 5 people, 4: 2 people, 5: 10 people](/public/images/womenInSage/future_sage_days.png){:class="img-responsive"}



We took advantage of the diverse knowledge background of our group to work together
and learn from each other. It was an occasion for many "first times" among participants
who had very little experience with Sage:

 * 5 participants installed a source version of Sage for the first time (so that they could edit the source).
 * 3 used git for the first time.
 * 5 used git within Sage for the first time.
 * 11 got their first Trac account .
 * 5 got their first contribution to a Sage ticket.
 * 8 are in the process of getting their first code integrated to Sage.

We worked on [14 tickets](https://trac.sagemath.org/search?q=days82) during the week, 
6 of those which have been merged since the conference. All participants said they
had learned new things and it would impact their careers.

![Did you learn new things at this conference? 1:0 people, 2: 0 people, 3: 2 people, 4: 6 people, 5: 9 people](/public/images/womenInSage/learn_new_things.png){:class="img-responsive"}

![Did you think what you learned will have an impact on your future research/career? 1:0 people, 2: 0 people, 3: 1 people, 4: 10 people, 5: 6 people](/public/images/womenInSage/impact.png){:class="img-responsive"}

This also was an occasion to start projects and form more research and development collaborations for future.

![Did you meet interesting people? 1:0 people, 2: 0 people, 3: 0 people, 4: 2 people, 5: 15 people](/public/images/womenInSage/people.png){:class="img-responsive"}

![Have you started (or carried on) any project that could lead to more research and development in the future? I have started things and will try to follow up: 38.8%. I have started things and willdefinitely follow up: 35.3%. Nothing: 5.3%.](/public/images/womenInSage/projects.png){:class="img-responsive"}

All of this happened in a very casual and welcoming atmosphere. We used the common
rooms of the house to work. We cooked international, vegetarian friendly meals (some
participants had brought food and recipes from their home countries). We got to know
each other and shared more than code. All participants agreed that it was a very 
positive experience. When asked to rate the general atmosphere of the conference,
all of them gave a 5.

![How did you like the general atmosphere of the conference? 1:0 people, 2: 0 people, 3: 0 people, 4: 0 people, 5: 17 people](/public/images/womenInSage/atmosphere.png){:class="img-responsive"}

As an organizer, it was also very rewarding and it motivates me to do it again. To
the question: "Any other comment you might have?", we only got one answer.

<cite>All three organizers were so very generous with their time and expertise, and created a wonderful supportive environment. Thank-you!</cite>
