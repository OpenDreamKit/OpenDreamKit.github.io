OpenDreamKit’s project meeting will take place at European XFEL GmbH
in Schenefeld near Hamburg (Germany), from Wednesday 20 - Friday 22
June 2018. We expect about 15 participants at this event.

*!! Note that during Wednesday all day as well as on Thursday morning, a professionnal videographer will be running 6 interviews (or more if relevant). Viviane Pons will directly contact the participants who are likely to be required to share their points of views and insights (on ODK as a project, Jupyter, dissemination activities...). The content will eventually be added on the next version of the website once the videographer is done editing.*

# The 3-day long meeting will be devoted to WP2 (dissemination) and WP1 (steering committee and preparation of deliverables), with a side-workshop about Jupyter activities

=> [Open github issue to decide upon the content of the three days](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/270)
