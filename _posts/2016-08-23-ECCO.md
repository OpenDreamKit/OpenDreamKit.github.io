Last June, Viviane Pons participated to the Research School [ECCO 2016](http://ecco2016.combinatoria.co/).
She was there representing OpenDreamKit to lead two Sage sessions: introducing Sage
to the students in relations to the combinatorial courses they were following.

The school welcomed **130 participants** from very diverse mathematical background:
undergrads, grad students, postdocs, and professors. Each Sage sessions had **50
students** working on the School computers using [Live USB keys](http://www.sagemath.org/download-liveusb.html).
The keys were chosen to get a **very quick setup** (less than 10 minutes) allowing the
students to start working on the sage tutorials as soon as possible. They are a very good solutions
in countries where Internet connexion does not allow for massive cloud usage. As a result,
the students could spend their time working on the tutorials: from basic introduction
to more advanced combinatorics exercises. It was a real success! Many students brought
a copy of the live USB key home so that they would have their own copy of the software.

The conference as a whole was a very rewarding experience: doing a great job promoting
**inclusivity** and **diversity**. These are values we share at OpenDreamKit and we
were happy to be part of it. Viviane Pons wrote a [post on her blog](http://openpyviv.com/2016/07/12/ECCO/)
describing her experience there. This was then re-pubiblished on the [AMS Blog, On
teaching and learning Mathematics](http://blogs.ams.org/matheducation/2016/08/22/an-inclusive-maths-conference-ecco-2016/).

The course material can be found on [Viviane Pons's  webpage](https://www.lri.fr/~pons/2016-06-13-conference-en.html).
