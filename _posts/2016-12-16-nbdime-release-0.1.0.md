nbdime 0.1.0 has been released, implementing tools for diffing and merging Jupyter notebooks

Key features:

- nbdiff for diffing notebooks in the terminal
- nbdiff-web for viewing a rich, rendered diff of two notebooks
- nbmerge for merging three notebooks, with automatic conflict resolution that should always guarantee a valid notebook, even with unresolved conflicts
- nbmerge-web for manually resolving conflicts when merging notebooks
- nbshow for quickly viewing a notebook in the terminal
- git integration for using the diff and merge tools on notebook files by default
