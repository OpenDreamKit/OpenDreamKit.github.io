[nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io) has had its first stable release.
nbdime provides tools for diffing and merging Jupyter notebooks,
and inegrating notebooks into git workflow.
nbdime aims to alleviate some common difficulties when working with  Jupyter notebooks.

Particular features of nbdime:

- recognizing binary outputs that cannot be reasonably interpreted in the terminal
- recognizing transient fields and eliminating them from merge conflicts
- ensuring that merged notebooks are always valid
- integration with git as `drivers` for passive diff/merge integration and `tools` for interactive GUI integration

Tools provided by nbdime:

- `nbshow`: show a legible formatting of a notebook on the command-line
- `nbdiff`: command-line diff of notebooks, eliding outputs that are known to not be renderable in a terminal. `nbdiff` can be integrated into git as a diff driver.
- `nbdiff-web`: create a rich, rendered web view of the changes between two notebooks
- `nbmerge`: three-way merge with automatic conflict resolution, which can be integrated into git as a merge driver, ensuring always-valid notebooks and eliminating merge conflicts on transient fields.
- `nbmerge-web`: interactive three-way merge tool for manually resolving merge conflicts
