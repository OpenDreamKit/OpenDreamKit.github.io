## Achievements

K3D-jupyter 
 - project was ported to ipywidgets 7, (v 2.4.9), API is (mostly) stable
 - it is already being used by FutureProcessing (https://www.future-processing.com) by teams involved in data analysis and simulation and cfd analysis.
 - it is included in pip: 
 	
	pip install k3d
	jupyter nbextension install --py --sys-prefix k3d
	jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix k3d
