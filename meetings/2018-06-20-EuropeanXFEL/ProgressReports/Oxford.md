## Finance and administration

There was a small underspend on the budget in Oxford, around 25K euro, which is now used
to top up the salary for Pasechnik, the only paid person on the project at Oxford.


---
## Hiring

Since Sept. 2017 until April 2018 Pasechnik was employed for 50% FTE on the project,
(down from 100% from March until August 2017), due to the original budget setup of ODK.
Thanks to various funds reshufflings he is from April 2018 until the end of the project he is employed for 
70% FTE.

## Achievements

In the reporting period most work in Oxford has been towards portability of Sage and its components,
with patches contributed to MPIR, MPFR, Singular, GAP, PPL, Flint, Arb, Scipy, as well as Sage itself.
Most time was devoted to porting to clang (very important for support of Sage on OSX), and
work on MPIR and libGAP.

Pasechnik co-mentored two Google Summer of Code (GSoC) students in the summer of 2017, which resulted in
fixing long-standing stopgaps in the graph theory component of Sage.

## Work in progress

Ports of Sage to FreeBSD and Solaris, which have been abandoned and allowed to bitrot,
have been revived, and are well underway. Other projects are related to improving optimisation
capabilities of Sage, as well as capabilites to generate graphs and other combinatorial objects.

Pasechnik is an admin and a mentor (mentoring two students) for Sage's GSoC 2018 effort.

## Workshops and dissemination activities

Pasechnik attended a number of ODK and ODK-related workshops and meetings, including meetings in
Brussels and in Kaiserslautern. He helps with using Sage in teaching at Oxford's Mathematical Institute.
He also presented using of Sage in combinatorics in a minicourse in Tohoku University,
and gave a Sage-related talk at an optimisation conference in Tel Aviv University.
