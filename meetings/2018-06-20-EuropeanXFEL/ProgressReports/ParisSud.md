## Hiring

### One Project Manager on WP1 and WP2

UPSUD is hiring a new project manager following the departure of B. Pilorget.

### One postdoc on WP6

UPSUD hired on the O1/01/2018 , and for a duration of 18 months, Dr Florian Rabe as Postdoc. He will be working half-time on WP6 and WP4. Florian will be spending the other half of his time at FAU with Pr. Kohlhase working on the same thematics.

### One Research Software Engineer

Using left overs from Florian's half post-doc and other planned
positions, UPSUD has hired Odile Benassy as Research Software Engineer
early June until the end of the project. She will be working on the
technical/Jupyter side of Florian's tasks in WP4 and WP6, and in
particular [T4.5 dynamic documentation and exploration system](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/73)

### Three part-time trainees on Communication

Elisabeth Pluquet, Jeannette Nwedeck, Dilan Kocabey. The three of them are on their second year of Master's degree in digital communciation.Half of their time is spent in a company, the other half is spent working on two academic projects with their teacher. OpenDreamKit is one of this projects. Monitored by B. Pilorget and V. Pons their work focuses on: writing a communication plan, developing the website towards end-users, and creating media (videos, articles, interview etc.) to help us communicate and disseminate outside our communities.

The main outcome of their work will be a 3 minute-long explanatory video of ODK and Jupyter.

## Achievements

### 1st Review

The [review of the first Reporting Period (18 months)](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-04-26-ProjectReviewPresentations/)
was organized in Brussels by UPSUD on the 26th of April 2017. All
in all the work due for M18 was done and the overall
feedback was very positive from our Project Officer and reviewers. See
Nicolas Thiéry's
[debriefing notes](http://opendreamkit.org/2017/04/26/first-project-review-debriefing/)
for more information.

### 2nd amendment

This amendment catered for the move of Michael Kohlhase and
Hans Fangohr and their respective teams to new institutions. This led
to the addition of to locations (FAU and XFEL) respectively and the
termination of Southampton.

### Workplan revisions and 3rd amendment

At the occasion of the review, we were strongly encouraged to propose
revisions to our work plan, based on our latest vision of the project
and its landscape, in order to maximize the effectiveness and impact
of our resources.

UPSUD led the process, getting work package and site leaders involved,
as well as our advisory board. Our proposals were accepted with very
minor changes by the reviewers and implemented in a third amendment to
the grant agreement:

- new milestones were added, Key Performance Indicators were modified
- Objective 6 (social studies) canceled
- T7.4 integrated in T2.8
- T7.1, T7.2 and T7.3 cancelled and related resources were transferred
  in favour of T2.6, T3.3, T3.3 and T5.7
- Remaining work on WP7 moved to other work packages
- Consolidation of deliverables to reduce their number

This amendment was the occasion to officially terminate Jacobsuni and
UZH where all resources had been spent and no personnel remained.

All changes were implemented in the [github repository](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/).

The amendment is fully complete with the signature of the
Commission. 

### 4th amendment

A fourth amendment is required to allow the change of position of Mike Croucher to the University of Leeds. The principle of this amendment was accepted both by the Commission and the Steering Committee. Though practicalitites are not over with yet, the retroactive addition of the partner (and termination of USHEFFIELD) will start from 01/05/2018.

## Work in progress

### OpenDreamKit and EOSC

UPDATE BY NICOLAS???

* Strategy: last November, N. Thiéry, B. Pilorget, and H. Fangohr
  participated to two events in Brussels dedicated to the the future
  European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). We aimed at understanding this
  future network and what opportunities it offered for our
  communities. A [blogpost](http://opendreamkit.org/2017/12/06/EOSC/)
  was written on the matter. For the time being, ODK has not yet
  expressed official support to EOSC. The steering committee is
  welcome to express their interest or disinterest in this project.

* Partnership with EGI (main stakeholder of the EOSC): there is an
  ongoing collaboration between EGI and OpenDreamKit for the
  JupyterHub and BinderHub-based EGI services. Proofs of concepts for
  both have been deployed by Enol Fernandez from EG. To proceed
  further, a Technology Provider Agreement must be signed between EGI
  and OpenDreamKit/Jupyter developers in the next weeks. Depending on
  the success of this joint work and of the need of the EOSC
  post-2020, the collaboration could be extended.

### Numfocus Europe

- Nicolas participated to Sylvain Corlay's effort in setting up
  Numfocus Europe (to be announced officially soon), an umbrella
  association whose mission is to make it easier in Europe for
  companies to financially support open source computational software.

### Portability and build system for SageMath

- Finalization of Cygwin's port of SageMath [https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/66].
  See Erik's [blog post](http://opendreamkit.org/2017/10/11/SageWindows/).
  Report to be finished and submitted soon.

### Misc technical achievements

- WP3:

  - Python 3 support, build system, and continuous integration for
    SageMath (in collaboration with Logilab)

- WP4:

  - Enabling binder and ThebeLab for SageMath, for live documentation, reproducible notebooks, etc
    (close to final integration); contributions to ThebeLab.

  - Jupyter Widgets for combinatorics objects and dynamic
    documentation and exploration.

  - Heavy contributions to xeus-cling, a C++ kernel for Jupyter

- WP5: HPC for combinatorics

- WP6: OpenMath serialization for SageMath & Python based on Python's
  native serialization ("pickling")

### Communication strategy 

- The outcome of the three trainees' work will be an improvement of the communcation of ODK towards outside the consortium.
Will be impacted: the website, KPIs (mostly success stories for which media is required). The first visible action to the consortium were polls sent our to participants: a [poll for thematics](https://pluquetelisabeth.typeform.com/to/uTnjIQ) and a [poll about the website and project](https://pluquetelisabeth.typeform.com/to/lzujKT) in general. The first answers are currently being looked into.

- UPSUD paid for the services of a professional videographer who will lead and film interviews of key OpenDreamKit actors at the XFEL. these interviews will hopefully allow the addition of great communication and dissemiantion content on the website.

## ODK Use Cases

For the first time this year, we used a *Jupyter Hub* and
the newly developed *Cling C++ kernel* in our 300 student
[introductory programming course](http://nicolas.thiery.name/Enseignement/Info111/)
at Paris Sud. This was the occasion to test those technologies both
from a technical and pedagogical point of view. We contributed back
through many bug reports and feature requests.
