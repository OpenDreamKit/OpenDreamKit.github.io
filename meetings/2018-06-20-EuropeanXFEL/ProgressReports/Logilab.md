## Achievements

Publication of a new version of the Pythran library that allows to
compile Python code into HPC-optimized high performance code. See
http://serge-sans-paille.github.io/pythran-stories/toward-a-simpler-and-faster-pythran-compiler.html

Publication of a new version of the SciViJS library for
post-processing and visualizing 3D datasets with a full javascript
library that can be used inside or outside Jupyter notebooks. This
version can use post-processing plugins written in javascript or in
C++ compiled with WebAssembly. See
https://hg.logilab.org/review/scivijs

New version of simulagora.com virtual research environment that allows
users to prepare customized virtual machines embedding a set of softwares
and to deploy "tools" that can be described as micro web applications
that require very little development skills to set up, but make it easy
to make available complex simulations to users.

Packaging of SageMath 8.2 in Conda

## Work in progress

Study of the impact of the use of the Pythran compiler inside SageMath
and SciPy where computational algorithms might benefit from a
HPC-optimized code.

Integration of Pythran into Cython in order to use Pythran optimized
code for some computational operations (NumPy or standard library).

Library for exporting code samples from Sphinx documents into a set of
Jupyter notebooks and for integrating back the code outputs computed
by Jupyter into the Sphinx documents.

Simulagora.com virtual research environment has been under heavy development
since the summer 2017 and a new version will be online in March 2018. This will
showcase virtual desktops available from a web browser and collaboration
workflows based on "tools" that can be described as micro web applications that
require very little development skills to set up, but make it easy to make
available complex simulations to users.

## Workshops and dissemination activities

Participation to ODK's [Workshop on live structured
documents](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/211)
October 16-20 of 2017, Oslo

Library for exporting code samples from Sphinx documents into a set of Jupyter
notebooks and for integrating back the code outputs computed by Jupyter into
the Sphinx documents.

Packaging of Sage and related libraries in Conda and Debian, trying to set
up a continuous integration process.
