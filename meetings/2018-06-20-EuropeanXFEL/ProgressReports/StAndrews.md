- Work with Michael Kohlhase (WP6), including visit of Markus to Erlangen in June and Paris in November, MathInTheMiddle package

- Implementation of Schreier-Sims algorithm in HPC-GAP (Markus, intern Lucas Jones)

- Implementation of Parallel Froidure-Pin (Markus, intern Alasdair MacIndoe). Paper with James Mitchell and Julius Jonasus in "Portugaliae Mathematicae"

- Paper "New refiners for permutation group search" and implementation (Markus, Chris Jefferson and Rebecca Waldecker)

- Paper "Minimal and Canonical Images" and implementation (Markus, Eliza Jonauskyte, Chris Jefferson and Rebecca Waldecker)

- Paper "Constructing Majorana Representations" (Markus and Madeleine Whybrow)

- Paper "Francy - An Interactive Discrete Mathematics Framework for GAP" (Markus and Manuel Martins)

- Paper "Experimenting with braces" (Alexander, Agata Smoktunowicz and Leandro Vendramin)

## Work in progress

- Ongoing GAP developments in the areas relevant to WP3-WP6

- GAP Syntax Tree Work and Optimiser, Pragmas

- LibGAP API specification

- Fully functional MathInTheMiddle server for GAP, Singular, and Pari

- Madeleine Whybrow and Markus Pfeiffer computed all previously known Majorana Representations with an independent implementation of Seress' algorithm, now computing previously unknown ones

- The meataxe64 GAP package and contributions to the underlying meataxe64 libraries, providing a major advance on the state of the art in linear algebra and computational representation theory in high dimensions over finite fields on multicore computers

- p-adic solutions to systems of equations over the rationals using meataxe64 (as a package)

- Chinese remaindering to solve equations over the rationals using meataxe64 (Markus and Kirill Rodrigues (intern)) 

- A new approach to proving hyperbolicity GAP package anatph (Markus, Colva Roney-Dougal, Derek Holt, close to submission), I am working on a better version of the algorithm

- Solving equations over the free group using constraint methods (Markus, Daphne Bogosian (Student), Peter Nightingale)

- Sabbatical of Nathan Carter (Bentley University, USA) for a year, starting from August 2018 to work on topics related to WP6

## Other

Collaboration/synergy with other projects:

- CoDiMa (CCP in Computational Discrete Mathematics, http://www.codima.ac.uk/) is a EPSRC-funded community building project centred around GAP and SageMath. It enhances dissemination of OpenDreamKit results in the UK through its traning events and research visits programme

- Symbolic Tools in Mathematics and their Application (https://www.computeralgebra.de/sfb/) is a new DFG-funded project which develops a computer algebra system called OSCAR (Open Source Computer Algebra Resource) which is based on GAP, Singular, Polymake and ANTIC systems
