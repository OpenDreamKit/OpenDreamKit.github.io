title: Computational Mathematics with Jupyter
---

This workshop will take place at the 
[International Centre for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.icms.org.uk/)
in Edinburgh on 16-20 January 2017. It is organised jointly by the 
[OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org/) and [CoDiMa](http://www.codima.ac.uk/)
projects.

We invite developers and users with programming experience (at least at the 
beginner's level) interested in [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/), 
[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/), [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/),
[Python](https://www.python.org/), [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), and related 
projects and using them in research and/or teaching.

The workshop will have format similar to previous [SageMath days](https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops) 
and [GAP days](http://gapdays.de/). Approximately a half of the activities will be in the form of 
lectures and tutorials, and the other half would consist of collaborative coding and documentation 
sprints in parallel break-out groups, suggested by participants (to see some anticipated activities,
see [this discussion](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/208) on GitHub).

The focus of the workshop is on various components from the [Jupyter's ecosystem](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/visual_overview.html) and
related projects such as, for example, Jupyter notebooks kernels for mathematical
software systems, and their applications in research, training and teaching.

# Programme

[PAD for reports and discussions](https://mensuel.framapad.org/p/jupyter-codima)


The programme of the workshop and link to slides and supplementary materials could be found [here](programme). 

We will hold presentations and tutorials during morning sessions, and concurrent 
coding and documentation sprints during afternoon sessions (except swapping 
them places on Thursday). Actitivies that will take place in the afternoons 
and their schedule will be decided at the beginning of the workshop dependently 
on how many people will sign up to the proposed coding and documentation sprints. 
At the end of each day we will hear brief reports from group activities.

- **9.30** - morning sessions begin
- **11.00** - coffee break
- **13.00** - lunch
- **15.30** - coffee break
- **17.00** - ICMS is closed for visitors

**Workshop dinner:** Wednesday, 18th January, 18.30-21.00,

# Venue

The [International Centre for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.icms.org.uk/) is 
a mathematical research centre which brings together mathematicians and practitioners 
in science, industry and commerce for research workshops and other meetings. See
[this page](http://www.icms.org.uk/information/facilities) for the details about
its facilities and travel directions. ICMS provides Eduroam wireless network,
but in order to be able to connect, you have to configure it at your home 
institution before travel. Alternatively, please ask for guest logins at the
workshop.

# Registration (closed)

Registration for the workshop is free of charge, but all participants need to register 
as the number of places is limited. If you plan to come, we will appreciate if you 
could register as soon as possible to help us with planning. The deadline for the
registration is **January 7th, 2017**. To fill in the registration form please proceed to
