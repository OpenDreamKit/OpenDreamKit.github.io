title: Programme of the workshop
---

This is the programme for the
[Computational Mathematics with Jupyter](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-01-16-ICMS/) workshop.

We will hold presentations and tutorials during morning sessions, and
concurrent coding and documentation sprints during afternoon sessions
(except swapping them places on Thursday). Actitivies that will take
place in the afternoons and their schedule will be decided at the
beginning of the workshop depending on how many people will sign up
to the proposed coding and documentation sprints. At the end of
each day we will hear brief reports from group activities.

- **9.30** - morning sessions begin
- **11.00** - coffee break
- **13.00** - lunch
- **15.30** - coffee break
- **16.45** - reports from groups
- **17.00** - ICMS is closed for visitors

## Monday, 16th January

* Welcoming and introductions

### Presentations and tutorials (morning)

[[pdf]](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-01-16-ICMS/talks/2017-01-16-GAP-Docker-Konovalov.pdf)

### Sprints

* Finalising the schedule of concurrent coding and documentation sprints

* **Installation and setup**: if you haven't installed all relevant software
prior to the workshop, we will help you with this (for example, install
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) to follow the forthcoming Jupyter tutorial;
install releases or development versions of GAP, SageMath, etc.)

* **Integrate Semigroups++ into Sage**: we will attempt to
  incorporate
  [Semigroups++](https://james-d-mitchell.github.io/semigroupsplusplus/) into
  Sage.

* **How to contribute to GAP and make a GAP package** (lead: Alexander Konovalov)

* **Jupyter Interactions** Develop this skeletal repo into a community project. Aim is to have a range of peer reviewed interactive pieces of code for use in teaching and research. [https://github.com/mikecroucher/jupyter-interactions](https://github.com/mikecroucher/jupyter-interactions) (lead: Mike Croucher)

* **Developing [Software Carpentry lesson on SageMath](http://alex-konovalov.github.io/sage-lesson/)**
(leads: Alexander Konovalov, Raniere Silva): we would like to make progress with establishing
the Software Carpentry lesson on SageMath, which is being at the early development stage in
[this repository](https://github.com/alex-konovalov/sage-lesson). If there will be an interest,
we can also look at the [Software Carpentry lesson on GAP](http://alex-konovalov.github.io/gap-lesson/)

[JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) and other tools

* **Integrate Semigroups++ into Sage**: we will attempt to
  incorporate
  [Semigroups++](https://james-d-mitchell.github.io/semigroupsplusplus/) into
  Sage.


## Wednesday, 18th January

### Presentations and tutorials (morning)

* Jeroen Demeyer: **IPywidgets and interact functions**

* Mike Croucher: **[An introduction to SageMathCloud for lecturers](https://github.com/mikecroucher/SMC_tutorial)**

### Sprints (afternoon)

* **Contributing to [STACK](https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_stack)** (lead: Chris Sangwin):
STACK is a computer aided assessment package for mathematics, which provides a
new question type for the Moodle quiz. Using it, one could use the computer
algebra system [Maxima](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/) to validate answers

* **Improving documentation for [An introduction to SageMathCloud for lecturers](https://github.com/mikecroucher/SMC_tutorial)**
(lead: Mike Croucher): follow-up activity for the morning talk

* **Integrate Semigroups++ into Sage**: we will attempt to
  incorporate
  [Semigroups++](https://james-d-mitchell.github.io/semigroupsplusplus/) into
  Sage.

* **Tannakian symbols** (leads: Torstein Vik, Andreas Holmstrom): 
Sage code for Tannakian symbols, a tool for computations in certain 
algebraic structures called lambda-rings and Adams algebras, which 
appear naturally in number theory and representation theory.

**Workshop dinner:** Wednesday, 18th January, 18.30-21.00, [Vittoria on the Bridge](http://www.vittoriagroup.co.uk/vittoriabridge/contact-us/) (19 George IV Bridge, Edinburgh, Scotland, EH1 1EN)

## Thursday, 19th January

**Remark**: in the morning, all OpenDreamKit Steering Committee members will be
at the meeting [here](http://opendreamkit.org/2017/01/19/EdinburghSteeringCommittee/),
so we will have coding sprints first, and then presentations and tutorials in
the afternoon.

### Sprints (morning)

* To be selected.

### Presentations and tutorials (afternoon)

* Sylvain Corlay: **Custom widget libraries and extending [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)**, see [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SylvainCorlay/CoDimaJan2017)

## Friday, 20th January

### Presentations and tutorials (morning)

* Hans Fangohr and Marijan Beg: **A case study of computational science in Jupyter notebooks: [JOOMMF](https://joommf.github.io)**

* Mark Quinn: **Using SageMathCloud for teaching undergraduate physics**

### Sprints (afternoon)

* To be selected.


## Coding and documentation sprints yet to be scheduled

We will schedule these sprints during our planning session on Monday,
dependently on how many participants will be interested to join them.
Some of these sprints may be recurring for several days.

* **Introduction to [Symbolic Computation Software Composability Protocol (SCSCP)](http://www.symbolic-computing.org/scscp)**
(lead: Alexander Konovalov): SCSCP is a remote procedure call protocol
supported by several computer algebra systems and another software tools.
I could demonstrate how to use it, and provide further guidelines for using
it in your code. This could cover the new Python packages
[`scscp`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scscp/) and
[`openmath`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/openmath) (see their repositories
at [`py-scscp`(https://github.com/OpenMath/py-scscp/) and
[`py-openmath`](https://github.com/OpenMath/py-openmath)).

* **[NumericalSgps](https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/numericalsgps.html)**
(lead: Pedro A. García Sánchez): NumericalSgps is a gap package for numerical semigroups. It benefits from other gap packages and software. The development version can be found in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/gap-system/numericalsgps).

* **Extending and integrating nbval and nbdime features** Developers of nbval and nbdime and others interested in contributing should meet to extend nbval and possibly nbdime.

## Desirable tutorials

Please get in touch if you're able to cover this in your talk/tutorial/sprint:

- **Publishing notebooks** with [GitHub](https://github.com/blog/1995-github-jupyter-notebooks-3),
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), [mybinder](http://mybinder.org/)

- **Using [nbgrader](http://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to create and grade assigments**

* **Deploying [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) in various ways**

As an option, we may just have sprints where we will try to make use of these
tools, following their documentation, and report our experiences.
