title: OpenDreamKit annual project meeting
---

OpenDreamKit’s annual project meeting took place at Jacobs's
University in Bremen (Germany), from Monday the 27th of June to Friday
the 1st of July. It gathered 21 ODK participants together with ODK's
project officer and three reviewers from the EU Commission.

The beginning of the week was dedicated to ODK’s open
and internal meetings, including an informal review with our Project
Officer and the Commission reviewers. The rest of the week was
dedicated to joint work sessions on WP4 (User Interfaces) & WP6
(Data/Knowledge/Software bases, aka Math-in-the-middle) activities.

This meeting was the occasion to build a common overview of what was
achieved during the first ten months, and plan together work on the
upcoming tasks and deliverables. The informal project review was
enormously helpful to get early feedback and start preparing for the
upcoming formal review at Month 18 (March 2017).

# How to come

The fastest way from the airport is certainly taking a cab (ca 20 min).
Taking the tram/train takes an hour to 90 min.
