# Position of Paul-Oliver DEHAYE in UZH/Michael KOHLHASE in Bremen

 - Things got better thanks to the SC intervention. A contract is on track.

Most of the research group will move with him, FR (Co-PI) is not formally decided yet. 
The steering committee congratulates MK and will support him in moving his group and the OpenDreamKit project to the new university. 

# (Internal) financal evaluation

- Percentage of money spent, only 20.69% (without USTAN, Logilab and UOXF which have not replied yet).

Not everyone supposed to be hired was hired, but cost are growing thanks to a the (long) hiring process

The website does not advertise enough what we are doing despite the fact that the procedure is described on the [readme](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/.
MK and FR would like to see the activities (workshops; presentations etc) better advertised. LDF agreed to build a blog on the website, blog which will show activities. 
MK would also like to be more present in the media and to have the website built for people outside of the OpenDreamKit community.
