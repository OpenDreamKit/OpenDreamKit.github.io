The steering committee congratulates MK and will support him in moving his group and the OpenDreamKit project to the new university.

MK and FR would like to see the activities (workshops; presentations etc) better advertised. LDF agreed to build a blog on the website, blog which will show activities. 
MK would also like to be more present in the media and to have the website built for people outside of the OpenDreamKit community.
