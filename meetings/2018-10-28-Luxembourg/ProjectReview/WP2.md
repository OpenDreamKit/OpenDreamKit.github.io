## Our role

This workpackage is the **link** between the work we do at OpenDreamKit and the **scientific communities**.

--
## Our role

- **Community building**: Organizing workshops and conferences to reinforce our communities
- **Training**: Widespread our shared technical knowledge especially concerning new OpenDreamKit development
- **Dissemination and outreach**: communicate about our achievments, foster larger communities
- **Exploitation**: make effective use of OpenDreamKit development in science and research 

---
## Online communication (T2.1)

How to communicate about our achievements?


---
### A new website

## Impact: The Research Software Engineers community

![](../rse_slide1.png)

--

[Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) 2012 study found


![](../rse_slide2.png)

--
As a consequence

* Difficult to progress career in Academia
* No promotion
* Not enough research -- not enough IT/Computing

**The SSI came up with "Research Software Engineers" (RSE) and campaigned for this group**

--
