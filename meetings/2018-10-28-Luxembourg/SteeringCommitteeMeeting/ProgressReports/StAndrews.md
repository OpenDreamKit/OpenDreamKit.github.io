## Finance and administration

- Participated in the OpenDreamKit midterm review (April 2017, Brussels)

- Participated in the 2nd OpenDreamKit midterm review (October 2018, Luxembourg)

---
## Hiring

- Nathan Carter and Michael Torpey started to work for OpenDreamKit on casual contracts

- Markus switched to another project and will continue to work on ODK on a
  very small part-time amount of hours

- We are expecting some further developments on the hiring side shortly and are
  going to advertise a position of a programmer very soon to fill in this vacancy

## Achievements

- numerous contributions to GAP included in three minor releases (4.8.7-4.8.10),
  the next major release of GAP 4.9.1 and subsequent GAP 4.9.2-GAP 4.9.3 releases (WP3)

- work on the next major release of GAP 4.10 which is planned in November 2018 (WP3)

- regular maintenance and extending of the nomenclature of Docker containers for GAP (WP3,WP4)

- extending the nomenclature of Docker-based services for continuous integration
  for GAP packages (WP3)

- GAP interface for Pari/GAP (WP3), and code for Galois groups enabled by this interface

- New releases of GAP package SCSCP (WP3)

  uuid, ZeroMQInterface) (WP4) submitted for the redistribution with GAP and
  became included in it starting from the GAP 4.9.2 release

## Work in progress

- Ongoing GAP developments in the areas relevant to WP3-WP6

- GAP Syntax Tree Work and Optimiser, Pragmas

- LibGAP API to appear in GAP 4.10 release 

- Fully functional MathInTheMiddle server for GAP, Singular, and Pari

- Madeleine Whybrow and Markus Pfeiffer computed all previously known Majorana
  representations with an independent implementation of Seress' algorithm, now
  computing previously unknown ones

- The meataxe64 GAP package and contributions to the underlying meataxe64
  libraries, providing a major advance on the state of the art in linear
  algebra and computational representation theory in high dimensions over
  finite fields on multicore computers

- p-adic solutions to systems of equations over the rationals using meataxe64 (as a package)

- Chinese remaindering to solve equations over the rationals using meataxe64
  (Markus and Kirill Rodrigues (intern)) 

- A new approach to proving hyperbolicity GAP package anatph (Markus,
  Colva Roney-Dougal, Derek Holt, close to submission); Markus also is
  working on a better version of the algorithm

- Solving equations over the free group using constraint methods (Markus,
  Daphne Bogosian (Student), Peter Nightingale)
