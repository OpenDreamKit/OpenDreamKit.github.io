## Achievements

The visualization package K3D-jupyter has undergone following changes: 

 - polishing existing features, performance optimalization
 - CFD analysis module
 - Volumetric rendering method for data on regular grids  has been developed.
 - project was ported to ipywidgets 7
 - last version is (v 2.4.18)
 - API is  stable
 - it has been used at FutureProcessing (https://www.future-processing.com) by teams involved in data analysis and simulation and cfd analysis
 - the latest version can be installed with pip: 
 	
	pip install k3d
	jupyter nbextension install --py --sys-prefix k3d
	jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix k3d

## Work in progress


There has been done work on demonstrator  "Problems in Physics".
Demonstrator Linear Algebra  and Nonlinear processes in Biology are in final  stage of development.

There is an ongoing effort on development of documentation and tutorials for K3D-jupyter engaging student intern. The software has been deployed in JupyterHub environment for students of University of Silesia. There are planned dissemination workshops popularizing its application in e.g. physics courses and computer graphics courses.
