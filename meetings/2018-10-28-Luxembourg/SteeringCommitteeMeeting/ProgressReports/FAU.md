## Hiring
We have hired one researchers on a full position half-positions:
- Dr. Katja Bercic on November 1. 2018. to work on a general infrastructure on
  mathematical data bases using the MitM virtual theories framework.
  
---
## Achievements
- getting the WP6 use cases to work in collaboration with St. Andrews, UPSud, and
Warwick.
- getting a first prototype of the new [MathHub System](http://mathhub.info) based on the
  [React.JS](http://reactjs.org) working and online. This Drupal-based system incurred too
  heavy maintenance load and was too inflexible.
- fully integrated Jupyter into [MathHub](http://mathhub.info) 
- first prototype of TGview3D, a virtual-reality viewer for OMDoc/MMT theory graphs.

---
## Work in progress
- Further Development of [MathHub](http://mathhub.info) to reach feature-completeness. 
- Connecting PARI/GP to the MitM interoperability framework for extended GAP-based MitM use cases.
- generating Jupyter Notebooks for OMDoc/MMT theories and Documents.
- LURCH-based editing front-end for OMDoc/MMT (in collaboration with Nathan Carter on
Sabbatical in St. Andrews)
