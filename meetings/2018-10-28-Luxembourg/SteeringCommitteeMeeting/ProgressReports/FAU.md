## Finance and administration


- under usage of resources
-  overusage of PMs declared (we have hired student research assistants, but had to
   declare them as "researchers"; OKed by Nicolas)

---
## Hiring
We have hired one researcher on a full position:
- Dr. Katja Bercic on November 1. 2018. to work on a general infrastructure on
  mathematical data bases using the MitM virtual theories framework.
  
---
## Achievements
- getting the WP6 use cases to work in collaboration with St. Andrews, UPSud, and
Warwick.
- first prototype of the new [MathHub](http://mathhub.info) system based Drupal and 
  [React.JS](http://reactjs.org). This system was working and online, but incurred too
  heavy maintenance load and was not flexible enough.
- fully integrated Jupyter into [MathHub](http://mathhub.info) 
- first prototype of TGview3D, a virtual-reality viewer for OMDoc/MMT theory graphs.
- [Release 13 of MMT](https://github.com/UniFormal/MMT/releases/tag/v13.0.0)

---
## Work in progress
- Further Development of [MathHub](http://mathhub.info) to reach feature-completeness. 
- Connecting PARI/GP to the MitM interoperability framework for extended GAP-based MitM use cases.
- generating Jupyter Notebooks for OMDoc/MMT theories and Documents.
- LURCH-based editing front-end for OMDoc/MMT (in collaboration with Nathan Carter on
Sabbatical in St. Andrews)
