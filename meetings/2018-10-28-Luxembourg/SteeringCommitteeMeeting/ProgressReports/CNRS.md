## Finance and administration

* engineer Vincent Klein has been working with us for almost a year
  and a half
* CNRS financial report came quite late (5 days before the review!)

## Achievements

* (T5.3) cleaner linbox integration in Sage in collaboration with Grenoble, see
  [Sage trac ticket 22872](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22872)
  [25257](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25257),
  [25353](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25353),
  [24544](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24544).
* [D5.11](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/raw/master/WP5/D5.11/report-final.pdf)
  Combinatorics including [pplpy](https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy) (see
  [Sage trac ticket 23042](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23024) for Sage
  integration) and [e-antic](https://github.com/videlec/e-antic) (that will be used
  in the next Normaliz release)
* (not directly in the Proposal) finalization of upstream work on
   [gmpy2](https://github.com/aleaxit/gmpy) which is a component of pplpy
* (not directly in the Proposal) [Sage thursdays](https://wiki.sagemath.org/thursdaysbdx):
  On (most) Thursday mornings we gather to work on SageMath and related projects

## Work in progress 

* active collaboration between PARI/GP (Bill Allombert, Vincent Delecroix) and
  GAP (Markus Pfeiffer) for Galois group computations. Working prototype for small
  degrees.
* (not directly in the Proposal) cysignals port on native Windows
  [PR 76](https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals/pull/76).
* (not directly in the Proposal) Python3 support in SageMath
* two Atelier PARI/GP (January in Bordeaux and April in Roma)
