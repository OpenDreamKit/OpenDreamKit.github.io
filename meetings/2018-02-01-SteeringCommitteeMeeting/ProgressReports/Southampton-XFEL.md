## Achievements

* Updated proposal and JOOMMF work plan to reflect the removal of WP7

* T2.7 Open source dissemination of micromagnetic VRE
    * Repositories for source code under github.com/joommf
    * Set up publicly accessible Jenkins/Travis CI to
    * Added Docker image containing JOOMMF and all its dependencies to DockerHub
    * Another announcement made to the community via micromagnetic mailing list
    * Conda installation developed for OOMMF and all JOOMMF packages
      (OSX and Linux)
    * Set up read the docs for every code repository
    * Set up code coverage for all code repositories
    * Some unresolved problems with conda installation of OOMMF on
      Windows

* T2.8 Micromagnetic VRE dissemination workshops
    * Three workshops completed
    * Two workshops/tutorials scheduled
    * Publications, conference contributions, and tutorials listed in the "Other" section.
    * Details in the "Workshops and dissemination activities" section


* T4.14 Online portal for Micromagnetic VRE demonstrator
    * No separate machine was purchased to host it; using existing
      hardware at University of Southampton instead (courtesy of EPSRC
      Center for Doctoral Training in Next Generation Computational Modelling)
    * Online portal is based on Docker and provides the anonymous use of JOOMMF
    * Available [here](https://tryjoommf.soton.ac.uk)
    * Allows users to re-execute the tutorial and documentation notebooks
    * It will develop over time as further extensions to JOOMMF are made (T3.8 and T4.11) and more tutorial notebooks written (T4.13)

* T4.13 Demonstrator: MVRE notebooks
    * Jupyter notebooks documenting specific features of JOOMMF
    * Tutorials used for workshops ([here](https://github.com/joommf/tutorial))

---
## Work in progress

* Further work and extensions in all work packages.

* T3.8: Further developments and extensions (OOMMF Python interface)

* T4.9 & T4.11: 3d visualisations of vector fields, and widgets

* T2.7: conda package for windows

## Workshops and dissemination activities

Three workshops have been completed in this period:

* Institute of Physics (IOP) Magnetism conference, 04 April 2017, York, UK
    * details about the workshop [here](http://magnetism2017.iopconfs.org/OOMMF)
    * about 30 participants
    * organisers did not allow us to have the details of registered participants due to data protection
    * 19 participants provided their details directly to us: 6 females, 13 males
    * Workshop conducted jointly with Michael Donahue - developer of OOMMF
    * Workshop materials (tutorials and exercises) are available [here](https://github.com/joommf/tutorial/tree/master/workshops/2017-04-05-IOPMagnetism2017)
    * Co-funded with EPSRC CCP Computational Magnetism Network (EP/M022668/1)

* Intermag 2017 conference, 24 April 2017, Dublin, Ireland
    * One of the major conferences in the field of magnetism research
    * 50 registered participants, plus 7 additional attendees
    * Two sessions: main workshop event and the follow up session
    * The follow up session was used to go into more details about specific features of JOOMMF and to receive feedback and requests from users
    * Co-funded with EPSRC CCP Computational Magnetism Network (EP/M022668/1)

* 62nd Annual Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials, 06-10 Nov 2017, Pittsburgh, PA, USA
    * One of the major conferences in the field of magnetism research
    * Workshop conducted informally with JOOMMF users and people who want to start using it
    * Received feedback from the users as well as the feature requests

One tutorial has been scheduled for the upcoming period:

* Advances in Magnetism 2017, 04-07 February 2018, La Thuile, Italy
    * Tutorial session for all conference attendees
