## Finance and administration

- Participated in the OpenDreamKit midterm review (April 2017, Brussels)

---
## Hiring

- No activity in this period, but are we are considering taking on a programmer soon

---
## Achievements

- numerous contributions to GAP included in three minor releases (4.8.7-4.8.9), and the beta version of the next major release of GAP 4.9 (WP3)

- regular maintenance and extending of the nomenclature of Docker containers for GAP (WP3,WP4)

- GAP interface for Pari/GAP (WP3), and code for galois groups enabled by this interface

- New release of GAP package SCSCP (WP3)

- Native GAP Jupyter interface, and GAP packages needed to support it (crypting, uuid, ZeroMQInterface) (WP4)

- Francy - a Framework for Interactive Discrete Mathematics on GAP (Markus, Manuel Martins, supervised by Markus)

- Incorporating HPC-GAP (a code for shared memory parallel programming in GAP) into GAP 4.9 (WP5)

- James Mitchell collaborated with Nicolas Thiery on Semigroups package and libsemigroups library, with contributions from Markus (see https://github.com/gap-packages/Semigroups/wiki)

- Improvements of type/filter/category information in GAP (outcome of the work carried out under WP6)

- Published paper at MACIS 2017 (Markus, intern Victor Vasiliev). Maths in the Middle architecture (WP6) Docker container with Python, Singular, GAP and MMT

- Work with Michael Kohlhase (WP6), including visit of Markus to Erlangen in June and Paris in November, MathInTheMiddle package

- Implementation of Schreier-Sims algorithm in HPC-GAP (Markus, intern Lucas Jones)

- Implementation of Parallel Froidure-Pin (Markus, intern Alasdair MacIndoe). Paper with James Mitchell and Julius Jonasus in "Portugaliae Mathematicae"

- Paper "New refiners for permutation group search" and implementation (Markus, Chris Jefferson and Rebecca Waldecker)

## Work in progress

- Ongoing GAP developments in the areas relevant to WP3-WP6)

- Impact Acceleration Account grant application for a project to use Jupyter GAP interface in teaching

- GAP Syntax Tree Work and Optimiser, Pragmas

- LibGAP API specification

- Fully functional MathInTheMiddle server for GAP, Singular, and Pari

- Madeleine Whybrow and Markus Pfeiffer computed all previously known Majorana Representations with an independent implementation of Seress' algorithm, now computing previously unknown ones

- The meataxe64 GAP package and contributions to the underlying meataxe64 libraries, providing a major advance on the state of the art in linear algebra and computational representation theory in high dimensions over finite fields on multicore computers

- p-adic solutions to systems of equations over the rationals using meataxe64 (as a package)

- Anticipated sabbatical of Nathan Carter (Bentley University, USA) in 2018-2019 to work on topics related to WP6

## Other

Collaboration/synergy with other projects:

- CoDiMa (CCP in Computational Discrete Mathematics, http://www.codima.ac.uk/) is a EPSRC-funded community building project centred around GAP and SageMath. It enhances dissemination of OpenDreamKit results in the UK through its traning events and research visits programme

- Symbolic Tools in Mathematics and their Application (https://www.computeralgebra.de/sfb/) is a new DFG-funded project which develops a computer algebra system called OSCAR (Open Source Computer Algebra Resource) which is based on GAP, Singular, Polymake and ANTIC systems
