Training and community building is dear to the heart of our team mates. The OpenDreamKit funding has enabled us to multiply our actions. We (co)organize dozens of training events and summer schools in Europe and all over the world where we train the new generation in mathematics (and beyond!) to better use computational software. We run coding sprints where developpers from various horizons gather for a couple of days to tackle common needs together. Finally, we meet regularly to coordinate our actions, and go around the world to advocate for our software ecosystem, and raise awareness of open science and best practices.
